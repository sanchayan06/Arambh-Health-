# Arambh Health
=======
Arambh Health
>>>>>>> origin/main

Emergency-to-care platform. A monorepo holding three apps described in the
**Unified Build Guide v4** and the **Frontend Walkthrough**:

| App | Stack | What it is | Port |
|-----|-------|-----------|------|
| `arambh-health-backend` | Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL | JSON API owned by Dev 1窶・ (auth, patients/hospitals/emergency, consultations/follow-ups/timeline, audit logs) | `4000` |
| `arambh-health-ai-service` | Python + FastAPI + spaCy | Triage/symptom extraction (`POST /extract-case-data`) 窶・zero backend dependencies | `8001` |
| `arambh-health-frontend` | Static HTML/CSS/JS | No build step 窶・open with the VS Code Live Server extension | `5500` (Live Server) |

> All code files are intentionally empty. Fill each one in using the matching
> snippets in the two PDFs, then commit and push.

Notes
- `src/utils/aiClient.js` is a suggested shared home for `callAiExtract()`
  (called by Dev 2's `emergency.js` and Dev 3's `consultations.js`). It is not
  named explicitly in the guide 窶・rename/move it as your team prefers.
- Never edit a migration that has already run 窶・new tables get a new file.
- Backend branches (guide): `dev1-auth`, `dev2-patients`,
  `dev3-consultations`, `dev4-audit`. Merge into `main` the same day.

## Run order (local)

1. `arambh-health-backend` 窶・`npm install && npm run dev` 竊・`http://localhost:4000`
   (run `node src/config/migrate.js` after creating the DB)
2. `arambh-health-ai-service` 窶・`pip install -r requirements.txt`, download the
   spaCy model, then `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001`
3. `arambh-health-frontend` 窶・open `index.html` with Live Server; make sure
   `API_BASE` in `assets/js/api.js` points at the backend port

## Endpoint map (what the frontend calls)

| Method | Endpoint | Owner | Auth |
|--------|----------|-------|------|
| POST | `/auth/signup`, `/auth/login` | Dev 1 | Open |
| GET | `/auth/verify` | Dev 1 | Token |
| GET/PATCH | `/users`, `/users/:id/role` | Dev 1 | Admin |
| POST | `/emergency/intake` | Dev 2 | Open (no login) |
| GET | `/emergency/queue?hospital_id=` | Dev 2 | Staff |
| PUT | `/patients/:id/convert` | Dev 2 | Staff |
| GET | `/hospitals/:id/staff` | Dev 2 | Admin |
| POST/GET/PATCH | `/consultations` | Dev 3 | Staff |
| POST/GET | `/followups` | Dev 3 | Staff |
| GET | `/timeline/:patientId` | Dev 3 | Staff |
| POST | `/extract-case-data` | Dev 4 (AI) | Internal |
| GET | `/audit-logs` | Dev 4 | Admin |

DB tables (7): `hospitals`, `users`, `patient_profiles`, `emergency_cases`
(001) ﾂｷ `consultations`, `followups` (002) ﾂｷ `audit_logs` (003).
